# JWav Player

## Overview

A unique WAV player, allowing you to load in any .wav file 
and play around with a number of playback options on the fly.

The standout feature is being able to swap beats 2&4 automatically â€” which I hadn't seen elsewhere. 
This leads to cool results, try it on your favourite songs!

## Features

Features:
- Load and play wav files
- View and scrub through waveform graph

- Convert stereo to mono
- Invert channels
- Pan and Gain control
- Trim start and end length

Fun features:

  (You must know the bpm of the song, use tunebat.com)
